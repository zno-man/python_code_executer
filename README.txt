HOW TO USE python_code_executer_3.0

step1:place the .exe(python_code_executer_3.0) file in a folder
step2:type the code into a .txt file (for eg notepad)
step3:run the .exe file by double clicking on it
step4:type the name of the text file in which you have kept the code in
	(please do not add the file name with extension ; for eg if your file is "xyz.txt" just type xyz)

this has a limited number of python modules so 
import command may not work
